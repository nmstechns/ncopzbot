2. Set and Modify `user.txt` with your account data. If you don't have account, you can just put email and password that you want to register and it will automatically register account for you. Put the data in `user.txt` with format like this:
   ```bash
   email1,password1,proxy1
   email2,password2,proxy2
   ```
   if you dont want to use proxy, you don't need to put the proxy.
3. After put data in `user.txt`, run this script
    ```bash
    node setup.js
    ```
   This script will automatically register account if you don't have account .The setup script will automatically fill and save the needed data to the `data.txt`, it will look like this:
    ```bash
    email1,token1,proxy1
    email2,token2,proxy2
    ```
   if you not use proxy when registering account and want to use proxy when run the bot, you can add it manually or rerun setup.js with proxy enabled

   ```bash
   node index.js
